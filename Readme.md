# Advent of Code 2020 - Test Driven Development

For the fifth(?) year, Eric Wastl created another edition of [Advent of Code](https://https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code 2020").

In this repository, code solutions for the individual puzzles are collected.

## The right solution
There are several ways to solve the puzzles. If you don't mind complexity and fancy algorithms, you can solve this very easily. But for those who like to challenge themselves, it is also possible to achieve a solution with more efficient algorithms. But this has of course the tradeoff that you might need more time for a working solution.

## Test driven development
Every programmer should have heard of TDD. If not - or if you know it but don't practice it - you should apply TDD to solve this puzzles. It is a good training (Coding Kata / Coding Dojo) and will help you not to get lost while you fiddle around with your code.

## Who should do it?
If you want to learn a new programming language, practice your knowledge of algorithms and data structures, practice TDD or even learning to code. This project is a valuable source of training.
